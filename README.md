# Plan

1. Train the model of three different directions
2. save best weight, training curve, success rate and gif
3. PPT -> Curriculum Learning, fixed scene learning, random scene learning


right -> 570: 0.49 | 780: 0.71



Future:
1. more complicated scene -> facing cars from three directions simultaneous
2. different driving style
3. sum up
